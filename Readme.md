"Color Match" by Kurt Wyckoff

1)Designed game from scratch
2) Utilized javascript functions and jquery functions to
generate a sequence of lights flashing each round
3)Player attempts to click the matching pattern to win that round
4)If success, player goes to next level, adding one extra light each round
5)Created 5 second countdown timer for each round
6)Used jquery click handlers to start game and register user clicks
7)Made game object oriented, off-loading main.js to game, round, and button classes then tying back using "instantiation" via "this"
